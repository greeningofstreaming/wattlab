# WattLab — Project Journal

## About
WattLab is GoS's live energy measurement platform. It makes the energy cost of real-world content generation and manipulation visible, credible, and reproducible — using primary measurement data, not estimates. Not a dashboard. Not a calculator. A lab.

Scope: device layer only (GoS1). Network, CDN, and CPE explicitly excluded.

## Session 1 — 2026-04-03/04

### What we built
1. **Live power display** — P110 via local API, auto-refresh 10s, systemd service
2. **Video transcode test** — CPU vs GPU H.264 comparison, P110 + thermals, side-by-side report, server-reported progress stages, Meridian 4K pre-loaded
3. **LLM inference test** — Ollama, TinyLlama + Mistral 7B, fixed prompts, cold inference protocol, energy per token
4. **Focus mode** — 8 background timers suppressed during measurement
5. **Infrastructure** — Git/GitHub, SSH keys, Nighthawk AP mode, Claude Code on GoS1

### Key Video Findings

**H.264 1080p from 4K source (Meridian, 4 runs) — 🟢 Repeatable**

| | CPU (libx264) | GPU (h264_vaapi) |
|---|---|---|
| Duration (mean) | 174.3s 🏁 | 114.0s |
| Energy (mean) | 4.06 Wh ✓ | 4.42 Wh |
| Peak delta | ~85W | ~139W |
| Variance | 7.3% (3.4% ex. outlier) | 0.2% |

GPU 34.5% faster, 9.7% more energy. CPU wins on energy efficiency.

Crossover exists: GPU wins on short clips (<10s transcode), CPU wins on long. The crossover point is between 10-60s transcode duration for this workload.

**Methodology note:** CPU baseline drifts 51-58W between runs (OS thermal state). GPU baseline stable (~54W). Focus mode and 60s cooldown reduce but don't eliminate CPU variance.

### Key LLM Findings

**Cold inference (model unloaded before each run)**

| Model | Task | Tok/s | mWh/token | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Mistral 7B | T2 Medium | 59.3 | 1.028 | 🟢 |
| Mistral 7B | T3 Long | 47.6 | 0.943 | 🟢 |
| TinyLlama | T3 Long | 209.3 | 0.061 | 🟡 |

TinyLlama ~15x more energy efficient per token than Mistral. TinyLlama too fast (1-4s) for reliable P110 measurement — batching needed.

**Warm vs cold:** A contaminated warm run showed 161W delta vs 219W cold — 26% lower. Cold measurement (first-request cost) is more honest for real-world scenarios.

## Product Planning — 2026-04-04

### Two-mode architecture agreed

**Lab mode** (Simon, Tania, Dom, internal): full controls, editable prompts, export, settings, SSH tunnel access.

**Demo mode** (partners, CTOs, public): guided journey, curated, no settings exposed, proof-of-reality mechanisms, GoS visual identity.

### Data persistence decision
**Flat JSON files, not SQLite.** Each completed job writes `results/{type}/{date}_{job_id}.json`. Survives restarts, directly loadable by pandas/clean_measures.py, no schema migrations, stays agile. SQLite deferred indefinitely.

### Prioritised roadmap

**Phase 1 — Research Integrity** (next session)
- JSON result persistence
- CSV + JSON export
- Previous results browser (last 10 runs, expandable inline)

**Phase 2 — Measurement Quality**
- LLM batched mode: load once, rest, run N times, measure aggregate
- LLM warm vs cold toggle
- LLM editable prompts + streaming word-by-word output display
- Video H.265/HEVC + AV1 presets

**Phase 3 — Settings & Lab Config**
- `/settings` page (lab only)
- Configurable: baseline duration, cooldown, repeats, rest time, confidence thresholds
- `settings.json` persistence

**Phase 4 — Demo Mode**
- `/demo` guided journey with Next flow
- GoS visual identity (logo on every page, link to greeningofstreaming.org)
- Inline methodology explanations, "more info" expanders
- "See previous run" instant result option
- Anti-slideware proof points: streaming LLM output, varied image prompts per run

**Phase 5 — Image Generation**
- Diffusion model via Ollama or ComfyUI
- Energy per image metric
- Live display as generated, varied prompt per run

**Phase 6 — Public Access**
- nginx + Let's Encrypt
- `wattlab.greeningofstreaming.org` domain (preferred)
- `/settings` blocked from public URL

### Open questions
- Confirm domain with GoS — `wattlab.greeningofstreaming.org` or `gos1.duckdns.org`?
- Which image generation runtime to install?
- Should video crossover point (GPU vs CPU efficiency) be a published GoS finding?
- Results directory — add to `.gitignore` or commit selected runs to repo as reference data?
